## Question
1 For unlablled data， we can give it one Pseudo-Label。They are samples without labels。But for synthesized data？Class or identity information is already given。The synthesized samples may not be so much like the original ones，cause the distribution may not be consistent with original one。

The base method for unlabelled data. 
> For unlabeled data, Pseudo-Labels, just picking up the class which has the maximum predicted probability, are used as if they were true labels.

The training method: just train it by using the predicted label as ground truth label.

But for synthesized data?
The simplest method is to give a small weight for these samples. **And Next？**
